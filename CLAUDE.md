# AI-Powered Educational Animation Platform - Detailed Specification

## Project Overview

A web-based AI-powered platform that converts natural language prompts into professional-quality educational animations using Manim, Three.js, or similar animation libraries. The platform is designed for educators, content creators, students, and professionals who need to visualize complex concepts through AI-generated animated scenes without requiring programming expertise.

## High-Level Concept

This project bridges the gap between AI language models and professional animation tools by leveraging LLMs to write animation scripts rather than attempting direct video generation. Users describe scenes in natural language, and the platform generates corresponding code in animation libraries, compiles it, and renders high-quality educational animations. The result is a democratized approach to creating lecture-style animated content that rivals professional educational channels.

## Core Technical Approach

### Two Primary Implementation Paths

1. **2D to 3D Mesh Conversion (Future/Research Track)**
   - Highly complex computer vision and 3D reconstruction problem
   - Input: 2D sketches or images (houses, objects, terrain)
   - Output: 3D mesh models ready for animation
   - Currently a research-level challenge with limited commercial solutions
   - Recommendation: Monitor research progress but focus on Path 2 for immediate development

2. **AI-Generated Educational Animations via Code Generation (Primary Track)**
   - Practical and immediately viable approach
   - LLM generates animation scripts in libraries like Manim, Three.js, p5.js
   - Users describe scenes: "Create a client-server-database interaction with visual data flow"
   - System writes corresponding animation code, compiles, and renders video
   - Stateless scene generation avoids context collapse issues common in large projects
